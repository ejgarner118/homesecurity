This document outlines the hardware used in the **Modular ESP32S3 Security Camera Network** project.

Each **Camera Node** consists of a Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense microcontroller with an OV2640 camera module, a micro servo motor for panning, and basic supporting components. A **Raspberry Pi** serves as the central hub/server.

## üìù Notes

- All ESP32S3 cameras are powered via USB ‚Äî no solar needed for v1.
    
- Future BOM add-ons may include PIR sensors, door/window switches, or I2C expansion boards.
    
- Try to buy extras of critical parts (e.g., XIAOs, servos) to have backups or expand quickly.
